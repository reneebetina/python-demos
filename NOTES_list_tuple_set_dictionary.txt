STRING - text ; IMMUTABLE
  Cannot replace a single character directly because STRINGS are IMMUTABLE. 
  To replace specific character, you can transform it to a list then do your changes

LIST is a collection of ordered data.	MUTABLE
  append()
  sorted()
  reverse()
  pop()
  insert(index, value)
  Search using the index

TUPLE is an ordered collection of data. IMMUTABLE-cannot be changed
  CANNOT BE SORTED
  CANNOT BE REVERSED
  The order matters in a tuple

SET is an unordered collection.	MUTABLE, NO DUPLICATE ITEMS
  add()
  CANNOT BE SORTED
  CANNOT BE REVERSED
  
DICTIONARY is an unordered collection of data that stores data in key-value pairs. 	
  MUTABLE, NO DUPLICATE ITEMS
  push()
  pop()
  update()
  sort()
  search / get value using the key
  CANNOT BE REVERSED directly - but you may sort then get first/last element

  
  To navigate elements, use ____.items(), ____.keys(), ____.values()
             # for x in dictionary_name.items():
             
   Approach 2: store dictionary values in a list then sort/reverse as you need.
